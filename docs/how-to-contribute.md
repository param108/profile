# How To contribute

The site will be available at <TBD>. This repository will always be public.

# Making a proposal

1. Fork this repository
2. Add a file to the `docs/proposals` directory with your feature proposal and raise a PR on this repository.
- use the format `docs/proposals/format.md`
3. If the maintainers agree to this idea (which they probably will) they will merge this Pr.
4. This document will be the basis of discussion between the maintainers and you on how to develop this feature.
5. Once the document is approved it will be copied to the `docs/rfcs` directory.
6. You along with folks who would like to help can start developing the feature on your fork.
7. Once you are ready raise your PR. Here is more info on how to work on a fork.

8. Once we merge your PR into master CI/CD should kick in to deploy to production.

# Things Left To Do

# Notes

The idea behind this process is to lay a framework to make communication easier
and, more importantly, written down.
